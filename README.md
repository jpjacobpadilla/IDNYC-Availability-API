# IDNYC-Availability-API

An API to easily check availability for IDNYC appointments across all dates, locations, and times.

Currently, due to the scarcity of available appointments, the bot is designed to print the request response whenever it encounters a response that doesn't match the typical format for an unavailable appointment. In most cases, this would indicate that there might be an available slot.
